## Brief overview

This rule ensures that any questions, requests, or tasks related to Material UI (MUI) are exclusively handled using the `mui` MCP server. This guarantees that all responses and actions are based on the official Material UI documentation and resources.

## Material UI Handling

- **Trigger**: Any mention of "Material UI", "MUI", or specific MUI component names (e.g., `Button`, `TextField`, `DataGrid`).
- **Action**: Immediately use the `mui` MCP server to process the request.
- **Goal**: To provide accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware answers and code based on the official Material UI documentation.
