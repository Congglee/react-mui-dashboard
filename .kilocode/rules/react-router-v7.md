## Brief overview

- This rule provides guidelines for working with React Router V7, especially its "Framework Mode".
- The primary goal is to ensure all solutions and information are accurate and up-to-date, given that this is a relatively new technology.

## Information Gathering

- When a task involves "React Router V7 Framework Mode", a new and evolving technology, it is crucial to start by gathering the latest information.
- **Priority 1: `context7` MCP Server:** Always use the `context7` MCP server first to fetch the most recent documentation and best practices for React Router V7.
- **Priority 2: Web Research:** If `context7` does not provide sufficient information, or for broader queries, activate web research capabilities to find current articles, forum discussions, and official announcements.

## Implementation

- All solutions, code examples, and guidance must be based on the information gathered from the `context7` server or web research.
- Avoid using outdated patterns or information from older versions of React Router unless explicitly required for backward compatibility.

## Verification

- After implementing a solution, verify that it aligns with the latest standards for React Router V7 Framework Mode.
- If possible, cross-reference the implementation with official documentation or trusted community resources.
